# AirlinePassengerSatisfaction
An airline company has shown a significant decrease in its overall customer satisfaction with its flights. 
In our data set, we can find customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as their evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.  
Our role is to analyze the data and offer recommendations based on our conclusions.
Some interesting questions we can answer to help with our analysis are:
Which percentage of airline passengers are satisfied? Does it vary by customer type? What about the reason for travel?
What is the customer profile for a repeating airline passenger?
Does flight distance affect customer preferences or flight patterns?
Which factors contribute to customer satisfaction the most? What about dissatisfaction?
I have worked on this dataset using Excel. I used some functions to clean the data and add more columns to help in getting insightful insights. 
The final report and visuals were made using the PowerBI tool.
